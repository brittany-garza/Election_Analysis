3. Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to 
   the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. 
   Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
	Since counties are divided by precincts, the script can be modified to 
	show voter turnout within each precinct. This will give better insight on which areas 
	need more voting resources.  
	
	The script can be modified to show which party had a higher voter turnout. 
	Combine the script with the previous example of voter turnout by precincts, 
	this will show which areas had more voters. This will show the election committees
	which areas the party candidate will need to campain in.
